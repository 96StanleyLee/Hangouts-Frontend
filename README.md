## Hangouts

Hangouts is a web application that uses latitude and longitude coordinates to pick the perfect spot for your next meetup!

A web application built in React with a Rails API backend. It uses multiple API's such as Googles geocoding api, and Yelp's API to help determine a good meetup location.

Users can have friends that have a default location set or if wanted, they are able to use their current location as a means of determining where their next meetup should be located.

Once the user adds friends to a meetup, restaurants will populate on a map based on a search term.
The location of the restaurants is determined based on the users current location and the friends invited location's. It calculates the midpoint using their latitude and longitude and shows six different restaurant locations
